# Mid-Term-Project
The mid-term PJ assigned by Prof. Zhang Li, including image classification and object detection. 

## Image Classification
The detial of image classification lab can be found [here](https://github.com/Evergreen0929/Mid-Term-Project/tree/main/pytorch-cifar-models).

Additionally, pretrained weights with different augmentation are provided [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1FDBt87OKZ3mL3Y8YcbnnKw), extracting code: io3w, including cutout, mixup, cutmix and cutout-MAE pretraining.

## Object Detection
Faster-RCNN and YOLOV3 are both trained and tested on PASCAL VOC. Introduction of Faster-RCNN can be found [here](https://github.com/misads/easy_detection/blob/master/_assets/_docs/get_started.md), and YOLOV3 [here](https://github.com/Evergreen0929/Mid-Term-Project/tree/main/YOLOV3).
